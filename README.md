# 🌟 **SUPER-IMAGE-RESOLUTION** 🌟

## 🧠 **Super-Resolution Image Enhancement using Deep Learning**

This project focuses on enhancing the resolution of low-quality images using deep learning techniques.  
By leveraging **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and popular frameworks like **TensorFlow** and **OpenCV**, this model intelligently reconstructs high-resolution versions of input images — recovering lost details and improving overall clarity.

> 📌 **Perfect for**: Medical imaging, satellite imagery, security footage enhancement, and more.
